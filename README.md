Deep Learning For Coders Lesson 3 Titanic Spreadsheet

This is the spreadsheet Mr. Jeremy Howard creates in Practical Deep Learning for Coders Lesson 3 (2022). Here he shows how one can use excel to do linear regression with gradient descent optimization as well as create a neural network with Microsoft Excel. I couldn't find the file which he goes through in this lesson so decided to create it. Hope it helps anyone going through the lessons. :)
